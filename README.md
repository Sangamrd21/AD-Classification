# AD-Classification
Final year project on Alzheimer's Disease using Deep learning approach.  
Alzheimerâ€™s disease is very common disease found in majorly elderly people, so our team worked on a project that would help radiologist to diagnose the disease and determine the stage using the model which we trained using ADNI dataset. First the data pre-processing was done on the MRI images using various image processing algorithms, initially we used transfer learning approach by training with five pre-trained model and then we built a fine tuned CNN model which performed better than pre-trained models. We achieved an accuracy of about 91% using our proposed model. My contribution to this project is mainly on building a fine tuned CNN model using Keras and tensor flow libraries.
